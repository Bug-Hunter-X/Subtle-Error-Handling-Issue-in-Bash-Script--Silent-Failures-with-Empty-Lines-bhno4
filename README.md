# Subtle Error Handling in Bash Script

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Bash scripting related to error handling and processing of empty lines in files.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file, but it fails gracefully when the file is missing. However, it lacks robust error handling for empty lines, which can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a corrected version with improved error handling that addresses these issues.

## Bug:
The original script does not handle empty lines correctly during file processing.  This could lead to the script failing silently or producing incorrect results.

## Solution:
The solution includes added checks to explicitly manage empty lines and enhanced error handling for the processing stage.
